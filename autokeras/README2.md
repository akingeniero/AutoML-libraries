# AutoKeras Binary Classification 

### Overview

This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform binary classification using AutoKeras. AutoKeras is a machine learning library based on TensorFlow and Keras, designed to simplify the creation and training of deep learning models. In this guide, we'll walk you through the necessary libraries to install and an example code snippet to get you started with binary classification.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin working with AutoKeras, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

1. **TensorFlow**: AutoKeras relies on TensorFlow for numerical computation and deep learning model construction. Ensure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

2. **Keras**: AutoKeras utilizes Keras as a high-level interface for defining and training deep learning models. Keras is usually automatically installed as part of TensorFlow.

3. **Python**: AutoKeras is a Python library, so you need to have Python installed on your system. It is recommended to use Python 3.6 or higher.

4. **Scikit-learn**: While not strictly necessary, AutoKeras can work well in combination with scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation. You can install scikit-learn using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

5. **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental library for matrix and numerical data manipulation in Python. AutoKeras depends on NumPy for data processing. You can install NumPy using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

6. **Scipy**: Scipy is another scientific library that provides additional useful functionalities. Similar to scikit-learn, it's not a strict requirement but can be helpful in certain cases. You can install Scipy using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install scipy
   ```

These are the main dependencies required to use AutoKeras. Depending on your specific project, you may need additional libraries or modules for data preprocessing, visualization, or model evaluation.

### Getting Started

To begin your binary classification project with AutoKeras, follow these steps:

1. **Import the necessary libraries**:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from autokeras import StructuredDataClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

2. **Load your dataset**:

Replace `file_path` with the path to your dataset and load it using pandas.

```python
file_path = 'your_dataset.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

3. **Data Preparation**:

   - Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).

```python
X = data.drop('Survived', axis=1)
y = data['Survived']
```

   - Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

4. **AutoKeras StructuredDataClassifier**:

   - Create an instance of `StructuredDataClassifier` from AutoKeras with specified configurations (e.g., `max_trials` and `overwrite`).

```python
clf = StructuredDataClassifier(max_trials=10, overwrite=True)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train, verbose=2)
```

5. **Model Evaluation**:

   - Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set and print the final accuracy.

```python
accuracy = clf.evaluate(X_test, y_test)[1]
print(f'Final Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')
```

6. **Confusion Matrix Visualization**:

   - Generate a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance.

```python
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['No Survived', 'Survived'], yticklabels=['No Survived', 'Survived'])
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

7. **Visualization**:

   - Visualize the confusion matrix with labeled axes and a title for better understanding.

That's a high-level overview of the code and its purpose. You can adapt this code to your specific binary classification task by replacing the dataset and target variable accordingly.
